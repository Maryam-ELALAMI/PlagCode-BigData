# PlagCode - Code Similarity Detection System

PlagCode is a modern, Dockerized web application for detecting code plagiarism and similarity across multiple programming languages using token-based analysis (Jaccard Index).

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Analyze Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and more.
- **Real-time Processing**: Upload files and track progress live.
- **Deterministic Analysis**: Reliable similarity scores based on token overlap.
- **Visual Reports**: Interactive heatmaps, relationship graphs, and side-by-side code diffs.
- **Dockerized**: Easy setup and deployment with full isolation.
- **Persistent Storage**: Scan metadata/results stored in Postgres; uploaded files + JSON reports stored in MinIO (S3).

```

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** installed and running.

## 🏁 Quick Start

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

2. **Access the interface**:
   Open [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082) in your browser.

   (The API is also exposed directly on [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) if you want to test it with curl.)

3. **Optional: access storage UIs**:
   - **MinIO Console**: [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001)
   - **Postgres**: available on `localhost:5432` (credentials are in `.env`)

4. **Stop the application**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## 🧱 Mini Projet 3 — Docker/Compose Architecture

This repository is deployed as a multi-container web application.

- **Container 1 — Web server (Nginx)**: serves the built frontend (static files) and reverse-proxies `/api/*` to the backend.
- **Container 2 — Application (Python)**: the backend API service (`api`).
- **Container 3 — Database (PostgreSQL)**: stores scan metadata, status, results, and alerts.

Additional containers (Kafka/Redis/MinIO + workers) are included because the application is event-driven; they are infrastructure dependencies and do not change the business logic.

## ⚙️ Environment variables

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust values if needed.
- The compose file loads variables from `.env`.

## 🧰 Administration commands

- List running containers:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
- Show compose status:
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```
- Follow logs:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f api
   ```
- Live resource usage:
   ```bash
   docker stats
   ```
- Stop (keep volumes/data):
   ```bash
   docker compose stop
   ```
- Stop and remove containers + network (keeps named volumes unless you add -v):
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

## 🔁 Portability & isolation (run on another PC)

1. Install Docker Desktop.
2. Copy the project folder.
3. Create `.env` from `.env.example`.
4. Run `docker compose up -d --build`.

Everything runs in containers connected to a dedicated Docker network (`plagcode-net`), isolating services and making the setup reproducible across machines.

## 🔍 How to Use

1. **Upload**: Drag & drop your source code files (at least 2).
2. **Scan**: Click "Start Scan" to begin analysis.
3. **Review**:
   - Check the **Table** for similarity scores.
   - Use the **Heatmap** to spot clusters of similarity.
   - Click "View" to inspect the **Code Comparison** and see exactly which lines match.

## 🤝 Development

- **Frontend**: Runs on Node 20. Configured in `frontend/`.
- **Backend**: Runs on Python 3.9. Configured in `backend/`.
- **Network**: Services communicate via the `plagcode-net` Docker network.
